# pdfTextAmountFilter
Filter PDF pages by the amount of text that they contain

Main advantage of this as opposed to doing this with a text based format (which would probably be more efficent time wise), is that if the pdf page contains images and not text, it will still work just as well

## How to use
Simply input the path to the PDF, input whether you would like to sort by higher amount of text or lower amount of text, and input the target percentage.
It will then be sorted into both unprocessed and processed folders, unprocess contains an image for everry page of the pdf (I can change it to delete it if this is overwhelming, and processed contains the images within your set limits).
